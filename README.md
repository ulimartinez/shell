Ulises's shell

Description
----------------
This program is a basic shell that propmpts the user and executes commands if it finds them. The following features have been implemented for this project:

- Commands with some or none parameters
- Commands with full or no pathname
- One or more pipes
- Background proceses
- Changing directory (cd)

All of these features have been tested in interactive mode. However, changing directory and background do not pass the test in [testShell.sh](testshell.sh).

This shell starts in the HOME directory, taken from the environment.

usage
----------------
In order to build the project, navigate to the shell directory and run

`$make`

To run simply enter `$./ush`
